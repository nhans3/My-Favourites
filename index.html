    <p>
      Cats have always been one of my favourite animals. Ever since I was a kid
      I had always wanted a pet cat because of how cute they were, but
      unfortuanately I wasn't allowed to. They're also pretty chill creatures.
      <i>(unlike dogs. I've always been afraid of them biting my arm off!)</i>

      I would usually spend my weekends playing video games with my friends. I
      wouldn't say that I'm all that competitive as I usually only play for fun.
      Some of the games I play are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Roblox</li>
      <li>Minecraft</li>
      <li>Call Of Duty</li>
      <li>League Of Legends</li>
      <li>and more...</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Sketching Section -->
    <h2>Sketching</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Though I may not be all that skilled in the art, I really love making
      various doodles and drawings all over my papers. This little hobby of mine
      started back in 2nd grade, when I was bored during a class and started to
      mindlessly doodle my <i>(imaginary)</i> pet cat. One sketch led to another
      and it quickly became one of my favourite passtimes.
